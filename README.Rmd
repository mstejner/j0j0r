# j0j0r

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `j0j0r` is to calculate the unscreened current correlation tensor of the plasma fluctuation model of [Bindslev 1996, Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestial Physics, **58**, 983](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021916995001298).

The code is meant to be distribution-agnostic, i.e. it should be able to handle any reasonable form of the momentum distribution. Integrals over the momentum distribution are calculated numerically. Analytic solutions, possible only in special cases, are not used/supported.

The package contains functions to set up a number of momentum distribution types:

* An isotropic Maxwellian distribution. 

* A bi-Maxwellian distribution, with drift along the magnetic field (z-direction).

* A [generalized Lorentzian / Kappa](https://www.spenvis.oma.be/help/background/distributions/distributions.html) distribution.

* A ring-distribution.

* A bivariate normal distribution.

* A slowdown distribution: an isotropic fast-ion slowdown with transport modifications as formulated by George J. Wilkie . See [https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01934v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01934v2).  

Apart from those, users are free to input new distribution functions of their own design.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("mstejner/j0j0r")
```
The package is not yet on CRAN.

## Vignette

The example below shows the basic work flow for a Maxwellian distribution. The package vignette gives a more thorough introduction and a discussion of the effects of strongly non-Maxwellian distributions. It can be viewed with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::build_vignettes()
vignette("j0j0r_vignette")
```

And on [https://mstejner.github.io/j0j0r/](https://mstejner.github.io/j0j0r/) under articles.

## Example

To run the example below, first attach the `j0j0r` and `magrittr` packages:

```{r results = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(j0j0r)
library(magrittr)
```

The code is parallelized using the [future](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/) and [furrr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/furrr/index.html) packages. To make use of the parallelization, first set a plan for the `future` package. Different plans will be appropriate for different operating systems. On Windows it could be: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
future::plan(strategy = "multisession")
```

A Maxwellian distribution can be set up with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = FALSE}
maxwellian_deuterium <- maxwellian_setup(
  n = 4e19,
  T_eV = 2000,
  A = 2,
  Z = 1,
  name = "maxwellian"
)
```

It can be evaluated and plotted with:

```{r maxwdist, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE, fig.height = 4}
calculate_distribution_data_frame(
  particles = list(maxwellian_deuterium = maxwellian_deuterium), 
  v_par = seq(-1e6, 1e6, length.out = 300), 
  v_perp = seq(0, 1e6, length.out = 300) 
) %>% 
plot_dist() +
ggplot2::theme(text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 12))
```

The elements of the current correlation tensor can now be calculated with the `j0j0` funnction. Here assuming a magnetic field of 2.5 T, a wave vector length corresponding to 3 mm waves, resolved angles of 60 and 86 degrees, and frequencies between 0 and 400 MHz. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
maxwellian_example <- j0j0(
  k = 2 * pi / (j0j0r::const$c / 100e9),
  phi = c(60, 86),
  frequencies = seq(0, 400e6, by = 2e6),
  directions = c("x", "y", "z"),
  B = 2.5,
  particles = list(maxwellian = maxwellian_deuterium),
  integration_method = "hcubature"
)
```

The output is a tibble with results (j0j0) for every combination of all values of the input variables:

```{r echo = TRUE}
dplyr::glimpse(maxwellian_example)
```


And the results can be plotted with:

```{r maxwj0j0, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 8, results = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
plot_j0j0(maxwellian_example, wrap_by = "element", color_by = "phi")
```
